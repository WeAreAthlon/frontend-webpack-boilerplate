### 27/10/2020

### New Features

* Configurable **browsers versions support**. It uses [`browserslist`](https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist#full-list) - just specify the browsers you want to support in the `package.json` file for `browserslist`.
* Configuration per **environment**
  * `development` - [`sourcemaps`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/devtool/), [`browser synced developmentment server`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/)
  * `production` - [`minification`](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/terser-webpack-plugin/), [`sourcemaps`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/devtool/)
* Automatic building of all template HTML files placed under `src/templates/`, no need to manually configure each file anymore.  
* See the full [README](https://github.com/WeAreAthlon/frontend-webpack-boilerplate/blob/master/README.md) file for all new features.

### Breaking Changes

* **Webpack** version update - support for [webpack 5](https://webpack.js.org/blog/2020-10-10-webpack-5-release/)
  * New `webpack` configuration files.
  * Webpack configuration restructure - split to `development` and `production` configuration files.

* Template files moved from `src/` to `src/templates/`.
* Removed `npm run bundle` script - no need anymore.
* JavaScript syntax cheker command changed from `lint-js` to `lint:js`.
* SASS/PostCSS syntax cheker command changed from `lint-sass` to `lint:sass`.
  * Configuration file is renamed from `.sass-lint.yml` to `.sasslintrc` for consistency.

### Updates

* `src/scss/app.scss` - grouped all demo page styles in a dedicated file called `demo.scss` for easer removal upon starting a new project.
* Added example demo code in `src/js/demo.js`
* Updated `README.md`

### Removed Dependencies

* `browser-sync` replaced with `webpack-dev-server`.
* `browser-sync-webpack-plugin` no need anymore as `webpack-dev-server` is used for this purpose.
* `cross-env` - not needed in this setup.
* `cssnano` - not needed to be provided explicitly, it is now a dev dependency of `css-minimizer-webpack-plugin`.
* `node-sass` - use `sass` instead.
* `optimize-css-assets-webpack-plugin` - missing support for webpack 5, replaced with `css-minimizer-webpack-plugin`.
* `style-loader` - no more support for inlining CSS with `<style>` tags.

### New Dependencies

* [`css-minimizer-webpack-plugin`](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-minimizer-webpack-plugin/) support for `webpack 5`.
* [`webpack-dev-server`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/) user to simplify development process.

### 21/12/2019

### Breaking Changes

#### Updated minimum Node version

* Minimum required nodejs version is `10.13.0`
* Rebuild our `node-sass` by running

```shell script
$ npm rebuild node-sass
```

#### File Loader, URL Loader updates

* Rename the `esModules` option to `esModule`
* Switch to ES modules by default (the option `esModule` is `true` by default)

#### SASS Loader updates

* Move all sass (`includePaths`, `importer`, `functions`) options to the `sassOptions` option. The `functions` option can't be used as `Function`, you should use `sassOption` as `Function` to achieve this.
* The `data` option was renamed to the `prependData` option
* Default value of the `sourceMap` option depends on the `devtool` value (`eval`/`false` values don't enable source map generation)

#### Style Loader updates

* The `convertToAbsoluteUrls` option was removed, you don't need this anymore
* The `attrs` option was renamed to the `attributes` option
* The `transform` option was removed without replacement
* The `hmr` option was removed, `webpack` automatically inject HMR code when it is required (when the `HotModuleReplacementPlugin` plugin was used)
* The `sourceMap` option was removed. The loader automatically inject source maps if the previous loader emit them
* The `ref`/`unref` api methods were removed for `useable` loader, please use the `use`/`unuse` api methods
