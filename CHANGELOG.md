### 27/10/2020

### New Features

* Configurable **browsers versions support**. It uses [`browserslist`](https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist#full-list) - just specify the browsers you want to support in the `package.json` file for `browserslist`.
* Configuration per **environment**
  * `development` - [`sourcemaps`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/devtool/), [`browser synced developmentment server`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/)
  * `production` - [`minification`](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/terser-webpack-plugin/), [`sourcemaps`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/devtool/)
* Automatic building of all template HTML files placed under `src/templates/`, no need to manually configure each file anymore.  
* See the full [README](https://github.com/WeAreAthlon/frontend-webpack-boilerplate/blob/master/README.md) file for all new features.

* SASS/PostCSS syntax cheker command changed from `lint-sass` to `lint:sass`.
  * Configuration file is renamed from `.sass-lint.yml` to `.sasslintrc` for consistency.

### Updates

* `src/scss/app.scss` - grouped all demo page styles in a dedicated file called `demo.scss` for easer removal upon starting a new project.
* Added example demo code in `src/js/demo.js`
* Updated `README.md`

### Removed Dependencies

* `browser-sync` replaced with `webpack-dev-server`.
* `browser-sync-webpack-plugin` no need anymore as `webpack-dev-server` is used for this purpose.
* `cross-env` - not needed in this setup.
* `cssnano` - not needed to be provided explicitly, it is now a dev dependency of `css-minimizer-webpack-plugin`.
* `node-sass` - use `sass` instead.
* `optimize-css-assets-webpack-plugin` - missing support for webpack 5, replaced with `css-minimizer-webpack-plugin`.
* `style-loader` - no more support for inlining CSS with `<style>` tags.

### New Dependencies

* [`css-minimizer-webpack-plugin`](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-minimizer-webpack-plugin/) support for `webpack 5`.
* [`webpack-dev-server`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/) user to simplify development process.
